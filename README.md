### A bunch of random stuff to showcase Markdown language

Here's an ordered list of things I enjoy:

1. Lists
2. Numbering systems
3. The number 3
4. Collections with less than 5 things in them

I can make tables like this:

**Table 1.** *Pros and Cons of taking STAT545 this year*

| Pros | Cons |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
|  Learn about version control software and statistics that will help with writing my thesis   | It starts somewhat early at 9:30am  |
|  Will actually be useful after my degree is finished      | Should have probably taken this last year when I was struggling to learn R |


Here's a checklist of things I need to do!
- [x] Start making this README file
- [] Finish this entire assignment
- [] Think of a third thing to add to this checklist
