# Load the Dataset
I am choosing to explore the *gapminder* dataset for this assignment.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
head(gapminder)
```
##Let's look at a quick summary of the variables
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```
##How many countries are in this dataset?
```{r}
length(gapminder$country)
```
Not sure how many countries are in the world but I assume this is **all** of them.

##What information does this dataset have on Canada?
```{r warning=FALSE}
filter(gapminder, country == "Canada")
```
##How much did Canada change between 1952 and 2007?
```{r warning=FALSE}
filter(gapminder, country == "Canada", year == "2007") - filter(gapminder, country == "Canada", year == "1952")
```

Over 55 years, life expectancy went up by 11.9 years, population increased by 18.6 million, and GDP per capita increased by 25 thousand dollars.
